------------------------ LAB 2 RESPONSES -----------------------------

1. Function a() begins at address 0x08A0
2. Is the address I would use to set a breakpoint for fibonacci. 0x091E
3. Type "b 0x091E" to set the breakpoint. 
4. Press "b" to look at all breakpoints. Removed breakpoint 0 by typing "c 0".
5. Global variable k is stored at 0x09B2
6. "dumpw k"
7. To put a memory monitor on k when it was modified type "mm k". If k was a char you could use the mX ADDR [SIZE] command. "mm k 1" since a char is only 1 bit and not 2. 2 is the default. 
8. "m" is used to view current memory monitors. To remove monitor 3, type "n 3"
9. pw 0x09B2 0x113
10. address of i 0x088A (i is static and preallocated)
11. address of i 0x088A
12. 0xFFF6
13.	0xFFF2
14. "fb ax 0x333"
15. hist
16. 0xFFFE
17. The stack grows down (decreasing memory addresses)
18. 0xFFC4 is the farthest the sp gets from intial. 
19. The moves 'above' the bp to [bp+4] and moves the value into dx
20. Return values are added to the ax register until sp/bp are back at original positions. 
21. "add sp, 2" returns the stack pointer to its previous position after a function call. It is effectively a "pop" of the variables that were pushed. 
22. 0x83C402. 3 bytes. The right most byte are the "2"
23. TIMES 2 db 0 allocates 2 bytes for the global variable K. It is filled with 0
